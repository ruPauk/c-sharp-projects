# Rocket
This series of tasks leads to elements of functional programming practice using delegates.
The concept is to control the rocketman through levels with different gravity types. Arrows show the gravity direction and its length represents the scale of gravity.

Practicing delegates. The task was to dive into the initial project and to implement three methods responsible for gravity and forces that affect the rocketman. As result the rocketman is able to fly and be controlled with `A` and `D` buttons.
